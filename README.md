A Complexity Science Approach to Fibrillation: An In Silico Hexagonal Model of Myocardial Fibrillation

This project is designed to computationally mimic activation patterns with the myocardium, using charge-based bond percolation on a hexagonal lattice.

The aim is to indentify how structural heterogeneity (fibrosis) impacts the type and location of drivers that produce fibrillation, and the persistence of this fibrillation.
